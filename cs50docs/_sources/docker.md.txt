# Docker

[Visual Studio Code for CS50](/code/) and [`cli50`](/cli50) (as well as CS50's own web apps) are implemented with [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/), "a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

To run containers on your own Mac or PC, you just need to install a container platform like [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), which is freely available for:

* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)
* [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
