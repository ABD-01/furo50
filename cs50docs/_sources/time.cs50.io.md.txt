# CS50 Time Converter

CS50 Time Converter is a web app at [time.cs50.io](https://time.cs50.io/) that converts (dates and) times to users' own time zones, as might be helpful for deadlines and events for teachers and students in different time zones. Its landing page supports manual input in numerous [formats](#formats), and its [API](#api) allows for links to specific (dates and) times. It guesses a user's time zone on a user's first visit but allows for manual override, remembering a user's selection thereafter.

## API

### Paths

CS50 Time Converter supports URLs of the forms

* `https://time.cs50.io/{start}`
* `https://time.cs50.io/{start}/{end}`
* `https://time.cs50.io/{start}/{duration}`
* `https://time.cs50.io/{duration}/{end}`

where each of `{start}` and `{end}` is a [combined date and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) in ISO 8601 format, and `{duration}` is a [duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) in ISO 8601 format. It is not necessary to encode any `+` therein as `%2B`.

A deadline or an event with no end time might thus use the form `https://time.cs50.io/{start}`.

For instance, all of the below represent Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 +0000, using UTC:

* <https://time.cs50.io/20380119T031407Z>
* <https://time.cs50.io/2038-01-19T03:14:07Z>
* <https://time.cs50.io/2038-01-19T03:14:07+0000>
* <https://time.cs50.io/2038-01-19T03:14:07+00:00>

And all of the below represent the same, Mon, 18 Jan 2038 10:14:07 -0500, using Eastern Standard Time:

* <https://time.cs50.io/20380118T101407-0500>
* <https://time.cs50.io/2038-01-18T10:14:07-0500>
* <https://time.cs50.io/2038-01-18T10:14:07-05:00>

An event with an end time might use any of `https://time.cs50.io/{start}/{end}`, `https://time.cs50.io/{start}/{duration}`, and `https://time.cs50.io/{duration}/{end}`.

For instance, all of the below represent an interval from Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 +0000 until Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 +0000:

* <https://time.cs50.io/19700101T000000Z/20380119T031407Z>
* <https://time.cs50.io/1970-01-01T00:00:00Z/2038-01-19T03:14:07Z>
* <https://time.cs50.io/1970-01-01T00:00:00Z/2038-01-19T03:14:07+0000>
* <https://time.cs50.io/1970-01-01T00:00:00Z/2038-01-19T03:14:07+00:00>
* <https://time.cs50.io/19700101T000000Z/P24855DT3H14M>
* <https://time.cs50.io/P24855DT3H14M/20380119T031407Z>

Times converted via CS50 Time Converter's landing page standardize on the shortest of these forms, omitting hyphens (`-`) and colons (`:`). 

Combined dates and times without an offset are assumed to be in America/New_York.

### Query Strings

where `start` and `end` are in any of the [formats](#formats) supported by CS50 Time Converter's landing page, and `zone` is any of the time zones supported by the same. Each of `{start}` and `{end}` will be assumed to be in `zone` unless a time zone or offset is specified in `{start}` or `{end}` itself.

* `https://time.cs50.io/{duration}/{end}?title={title}`

#### Zoom

Among the formats recognized by CS50 Time Converter's landing page is

```text

```

which is the format used in Zoom's registration emails, which means you can even link to CS50 Time Converter in those by editing the template for your **Registrants Confirmation Email** at <https://zoom.us/account/branding#/emails> to include something like the below:

```text
<#if meetingTime??>
${meetingTime}
<a href="https://time.cs50.io/?start=${meetingTime}">convert to your own time zone</a>
